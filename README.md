# Python Projects
Python projects completed with the Tech Academy

## General Info
The files found in the codingDrills folder are chunks of code used to learn the basics and application of Python. The code snippets below are from a live project in which we applied SCRUM methodology in two-week sprints. With 6 other developers, we worked on web application projects together. We collaborated as a team via Slack to exchange challenges, solutions, and communications. We used Visual Studio and Azure DevOps for version control.

## Live Project
Created a web application in Python using Django to store data from an API service, a scraped web page with BeautifulSoup, and input from an admin. Created a model, index and details page, edit and delete functions and code to connect to the main app.

### Build the Basic App
1. Created a new app using manage.py startap
2. Registered app from within MainProject>MainProject>settings.py
3. Created base and home templates in a new template folder
4. Added function to views to render the home page
5. Registered urls with MainApp and create urls.py for art app and homepage
6. Added minimal content, such as title, image, etc, and some basic styling to home

### Create Index Page
1. Created a new index page, linked it from art home page
2. Added in a function that gets all the items from the database and sends them to the template
3. Displays a list of items in the database, with some or all of the fields for that item displayed with labels/header
4. Linked art app's home page to the main home page


art_index.html
```
{% extends 'artApp/art_base.html' %}
{% load staticfiles %}
{% block templatecontent %}
<section >
    <div class="flex-container" id="jerseyCollectionPage">

### Create Details Page
Create a details page that will show the details of any single item from within the database, as selected by the user. Link this to the index page for each item.

1. Added a details template to the template folder, registered the url patterm
2. Created a views function that will find the single desires instance from the database and send it to the template
3. Added in links for each element on the index page that will direct to the details page for that item
4. Displayed all the details of the item on the details page

### Create Edit and Delete Functions
Allow for edit and delete functions to be done from the details page or from separate pages. Have confirmation before deleting.

1. Added an edit page to the templates (a pattern url)
2. Used model forms and instances to display the content of a single item from the database
3. Set the views function to send the information for the single item and save any changes
4. Included the option to delete an item with a confirmation that the user wants to delete

### Setup Beautiful Soup
Pt. 1
Create a new template for displaying information sourced from another website. Use Beautiful Soup (BS) to scrape the site and find relevant information.

1. Created a new template for displaying the content
2. Used BS to get the html data from a selected site as a navigable object
3. Utilized functions of BS to find sections of data based on tags

### Parse Through HTML
Pt. 2
Parse through the html returned and display the information you wnat to display. Make sure you are getting the indivdual elements and stripping away any formatting you don't want. Add a link from your app's home page.

1. Got elements out of the BS object, send just the values desired as relevant objects to the template (nested dictionaries)
2. Displayed all objects within the data scrape template
3. Tested to ensure proper functioning, did not need to do error handling
4. Linked the data scraping page to art app's home page
